# What is GitOps?
GitOps is a way to do Kubernetes cluster management and application delivery.  It works by using Git as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. With GitOps, the use of software agents can alert on any divergence between Git with what's running in a cluster, and if there's a difference, Kubernetes reconcilers automatically update or rollback the cluster depending on the case. With Git at the center of your delivery pipelines, developers use familiar tools to make pull requests to accelerate and simplify both application deployments and operations tasks to Kubernetes.

# Lab Contents

This lab will cover common GitOps fundamentals, as well as setting up a k8s cluster with the GitOps operators and integrating with a GitHub repository to showcase GitOps processes in play.
