# Thank you!

Thank you for taking the time to complete the lab.

We hope in after completing this lab, you have a better understanding of GitOps fundementals and how they can tie into an existing traditional DevOps model.


## Cleanup

**If you plan to do Lab 3, please keep your repositories, pipelines, and registry intact as we will be using those.**

If you want to keep your Gitlab projects around, just remember to delete the deploy key from the Config Repository to be on the safe side.

Otherwise, you can just delete both projects by
1. In the project, select **Settings** > **General**
1. Scroll to bottom and expand the **Advanced** section
1. Click **Delete project**

This will delete all images, pipelines, code, and deploy keys that were created as a part of this lab.
