## Cleanup

If you want to keep your Gitlab projects around, just remember to delete the deploy key from the Config Repository to be on the safe side.

Otherwise, you can just delete both projects by
1. In the project, select **Settings** > **General**
1. Scroll to bottom and expand the **Advanced** section
1. Click **Delete project**

This will delete all images, pipelines, code, and deploy keys that were created as a part of this lab.
