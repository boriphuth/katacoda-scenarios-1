# Thank you!

Thank you for taking the time to complete the lab.

We hope in after completing this lab, you have experienced some of the power of Argo CD. This tool is very feature rich and provides many more features and functionality than we can cover in this lab which is really just a surface-level exploration of the tool. To continue exploring GitOps with Argo CD, check out their official page at https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/

## Cleanup

If you want to keep your Gitlab projects around, just remember to delete the deploy key from the Config Repository to be on the safe side.

Otherwise, you can just delete both projects by
1. In the project, select **Settings** > **General**
1. Scroll to bottom and expand the **Advanced** section
1. Click **Delete project**

This will delete all images, pipelines, code, and deploy keys that were created as a part of this lab.
